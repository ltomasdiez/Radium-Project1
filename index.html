                        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/donald-trump.html">President Trump</a>’s relationship to risk has often come down to an abiding self-belief: It will all probably work out for him because it generally has. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Whatever happens, happens,” he said in 1991, declaring himself a “great fatalist” as his business fortunes wobbled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We’ll see what happens,” he said of North Korean nuclear diplomacy two years ago, blithely predicting that all would be fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Risk plays a part in everything we do,” he advised in one of his pre-presidential how-to books. “I could get hit by a bus while I am crossing the street. Things happen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet the things that have happened this time — a president who has consistently played down the dangers of a deadly virus, joining the ranks of hospitalized patients in his high-risk demographic — are nothing like the circumstances of Mr. Trump’s past feats of political, financial and reputational survival.

                         on President Trump and the 2020 elections.

                        He is, instead, facing something almost entirely unfamiliar to him: genuine uncertainty and peril, a moment when the comforts of his office and surname can only take him so far.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>If anything, the toll of the virus, on Mr. Trump and his nation, has reinforced how little his life of chance-taking had prepared him for the cold math of infectious disease.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In business, he has transcended consistent misfires with the risk-cushioning assistance of tax-avoidance schemes, bankruptcy court,
                        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html">his father's riches</a>
                         and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/28/us/donald-trump-taxes-apprentice.html"> a manicured vision of televised success</a> on "The Apprentice."
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>In politics, he has survived gambits that might have ended any modern presidency before his — urging a foreign government to investigate a rival, questioning the valor of war heroes, equivocating on white supremacy — because Republican allies have wagered that he is worth the trouble.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>But the pandemic could be neither browbeaten nor charmed. It is not impressed with his Nielsen ratings. It is not afraid of attack ads in a congressional primary. It does not comport with Mr. Trump’s longstanding principle that to modulate, to adjust in the face of distressing information, is to acknowledge weakness.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007376654/trump-health-coronavirus-update.html"> a video</a> released on Saturday night, Mr. Trump cast his departure from the White House as a kind of noble gamble — not the upshot of health hazards but the mark of a leader fluent in cost-benefit analyses and willing to absorb the consequences.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>“I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs and totally safe and just say, ‘Hey, whatever happens, happens,’” Mr. Trump said. “I can’t do that.”</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>The message was a functional extension of what supporters see as his swashbuckling political brand: a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/20/us/politics/trump-campaign-rally-tulsa.html"> perpetual appeal</a> to America’s inner dice-roller — “What do you have to lose?” he has long asked his audiences — requesting another four-year turn at the tables.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>In another video on Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had “learned a lot about Covid” through his first-person experience. His next move seemed to undercut his claim: Moments after posting this clip to Twitter, Mr. Trump was seen waving to well-wishers from the back of a sport utility vehicle outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, raising immediate questions about the wisdom of the stunt — and the specter of exposure for those who helped him carry it out.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>As Mr. Trump continues his hospital stay and doctors weigh the risks of sending him home, possibly as soon as Monday, the prospective downsides of the president’s standard impulses are impossible to ignore: The most protected man in America appears to have squandered his personal safety advantages, at once a testament to his administration’s failure to corral the virus and an encapsulation of Trumpian risk tolerance across the decades.</p>
