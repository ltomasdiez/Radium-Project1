				<p>With his political career, his business dealings and his 
                    reputation, the president has long bet that he can ride out 
                    difficulties. Now, though, he is facing an entirely 
                    unfamiliar threat.</p>

                        </a>
                        ’s relationship to risk has often come down to an abiding
                        self-belief: It will all probably work out for him 
                        because it generally has. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Whatever happens, happens,” he said in 1991, declaring
                        himself a “great fatalist” as his business fortunes 
                        wobbled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We’ll see what happens,” he said of North Korean nucle
                        ar diplomacy two years ago, blithely predicting that al
                        l would be fine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Risk plays a part in everything we do,” he advised in 
                        one of his pre-presidential how-to books. “I could get 
                        hit by a bus while I am crossing the street. Things hap
                        pen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet the things that have happened this time — a president
                        who has consistently played down the dangers of a deadly
                        virus, joining the ranks of hospitalized patients 
                        in his high-risk demographic — are nothing like the circumstances
                        of Mr. Trump’s past feats of political, financial and
                        reputational survival.

                        , a moment when the comforts of his office and

                        In politics, he has survived gambits that might have ended 
                        any modern presidency before his — urging a foreign 
                        government to investigate a rival, questioning the valor 
                        of war heroes, equivocating on white supremacy — because 
                        Republican allies have wagered that he is worth the trouble.

                        But the pandemic could be neither browbeaten nor charmed. It 
                        is not impressed with his Nielsen ratings. It is not afraid 
                        of attack ads in a congressional primary. It does not comport 
                        with Mr. Trump’s longstanding principle that to modulate, to 
                        adjust in the face of distressing information, is to 
                        acknowledge weakness.

                        released on Saturday night, Mr. Trump cast his departure 
                        from the White House as a kind of noble gamble — not the 
                        upshot of health hazards but the mark of a leader fluent 
                        in cost-benefit analyses and willing to absorb the consequences.

                        In another video on Sunday, Mr. Trump said he had “learned 
                        a lot about Covid” through his first-person experience. 
                        His next move seemed to undercut his claim: Moments after 
                        posting this clip to Twitter, Mr. Trump was seen waving to 
                        well-wishers from the back of a sport utility vehicle outside 
                        Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, raising 
                        immediate questions about the wisdom of the stunt — and the 
                        specter of exposure for those who helped him carry it out.

                        As Mr. Trump continues his hospital stay and doctors weigh 
                        the risks of sending him home, possibly as soon as Monday, 
                        the prospective downsides of the president’s standard impulses 
                        are impossible to ignore: The most protected man in America 
                        appears to have squandered his personal safety advantages, 
                        at once a testament to his administration’s failure to corral 
                        the virus and an encapsulation of Trumpian risk tolerance 
                        across the decades.

                        Those who know Mr. Trump say that a lifetime of 
                        burden-shifting has hampered his capacity to assess 
                        legitimate threats. Worrying was for the unpaid contractors
                        , the people without draft deferments. Worrying was for 
                        those who didn’t know how to win.

                        isn’t any way this could have felled him,” Gwenda Blair, 
                        a biographer of the Trump family, said of the president’s 
                        mask-less nonchalance in recent months. “He wasn’t, in 
                        his mind, running a risk because he’s pushed all the risk 
                        off onto other people — and the blame, if anything goes wrong.”

                        This instinct has informed his pandemic leadership from the 
                        start. He was eager to fault the Chinese, the Democratic governors
                        , the news media. He insisted he had a plan but at times offered 
                        little more than suggestions for dubious medical treatments and 
                        casual assurances

                        “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask,” the president 
                        said. “He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and

                        Mr. Trump took care not to betray too much concern, 
                        reverting to a favored phrase before his own results were 
                        announced: “We’ll see what happens.”

                        More often than not, at least before the pandemic, the 
                        lesson for Mr. Trump seemed to have been that nothing 
                        particularly terrible would happen if he followed his gut. 
                        For as long as he has been a politician, it has felt, to 
                        supporters and opponents, as if he were getting away with 
                        something — saying what you shouldn’t say, doing what you 
                        shouldn’t do — and defying the template for political 
                        risk management.

                        Some Republicans describe Mr. Trump as a kind of executive 
                        stuntman, trying motorcycle flips that he should probably 
                        avoid and hoping they land.

                        “For a lot of people, that causes admiration,” said Carlos 
                        Curbelo, a Republican former congressman from Florida who 
                        clashed at times with Mr. Trump and did not support him 
                        four years ago, “the way people would watch a daredevil.”

                        When harnessed appropriately, this approach can come off 
                        as distinctly American, projecting a sort of frontiersman 
                        attitude embedded in the idealized version of national swagger.

                        “This is America,” Mr. Trump said in his video over the weekend

                        In his national stewardship during the pandemic, Mr. Trump’s 
                        defenders have sensed not a reckless disregard for science 
                        but a cleareyed appraisal of pros and cons. They note that 
                        even those closely following medical guidelines can contract 
                        the virus.

                        Robert Jeffress, the pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a 
                        prominent evangelical Trump supporter, said his church had 
                        followed the president’s example, reasoning that a full 
                        shutdown would be both “100 percent safe” and devastating 
                        to the entire enterprise.

                        “We have to balance risk and reward,” he said, adding that 
                        masks and distancing were encouraged at the church. “I 
                        don’t think people who are drawn to the president have a 
                        death wish.”

                        It is far from clear that Mr. Trump’s own view of 
                        pandemic-era risks and rewards will change now that 
                        he is among the afflicted, especially given his

                        An acute case of the virus, she suggested shortly before 
                        his hospitalization on Friday, could expose him to “a kind

                        As the end neared, Mr. Trump maintained a cool distance 
                        and moved his cases elsewhere without telling Mr. Cohn 
                        why, rationalizing that there was no need to hurt the 
                        feelings of someone “so weak” by then.
